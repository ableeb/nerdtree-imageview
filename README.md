NERDTree Imageview
==================

Adds a menu item in the NERDTree that allows you to open an image or pdf. In
essence, it just parses the extension where the cursor is and opens it in Preview.

Really just for MacVIM, but you could use it wherever you have gvim installed.

Based entirely on this gist: https://gist.github.com/450906#file_view_image_menuitem.vim
but modified for MacOS.
